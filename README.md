# Assisted Living

This repo contains an assortment of utility scripts, executables, and functions. These utilities make my life easier by automating something or making something more accessible.

This repo is supposed to be a brain dump or backup of sorts. I will try to write readable and somewhat re-usable code with minimal documentation. Private information, such as AWS resource identifiers, keys etc. are obfuscated using environment variables. Subdirectory readme files should describe what's required to get things working.

Currently, things are designed around a single backbone AWS SQS queue. If you are not me and trying to use this code for yourself, keep this in mind.
